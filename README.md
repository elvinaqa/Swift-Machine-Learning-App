# Swift-Machine-Learning-App
Machine Learning application with Swift (Google's newly developed API for Machine Learning applications via supporting Tensorflow))

Python seems to be a bit slower especially when tweaking the model hyperparameters and going deeper with applications. When trying to understand what happens under the hood, it is obvious that C++ do not have any opponent in terms of speed. Basically, we can think of Swift as more Python-like C++, better speed, and more readability.

Additionally, any Python library can be imported to the code, without any further hustle. 
Ex: 
```let plt = Python.import("matplotlib.pyplot")```
